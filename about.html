            <h1>Webapp</h1>
            <div class="p1">A web application (web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the internet through a browser interface. Web services are web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain web apps.<br>
                Web applications do not need to be downloaded since they are accessed through a network. Users can access a web application through a web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari.<br>

                For a web app to operate, it needs a web server, application server and database. Web servers manage the requests that come from a client, while the application server completes the requested task. A database stores any necessary information.<br>
                
                Web applications typically have short development cycles and small development teams. Developers write most web apps in JavaScript, HTML5 or CSS. Client-side programming typically utilizes these languages, which help build an application's front-end. Server-side programming creates the scripts a web app will use. Languages such as Python, Java and Ruby are commonly used in server-side programming<br>
